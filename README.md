Version 1.1


This is a small plugin designed to be used on websites managed by Simply Computing.

Important Note: The plugin becomes locked to the user who initially activates it. Once locked to one admin user, no other user will see the link in the side menu. To avoid any other user resetting this, it is advisable to use the utility to hide the 'Plugins' link after activation.

The utility panel has five sections for settings:

1. Dashboard widget information

These fields are used to add a dashboard widget that gives the client the support details for contacting the website developers. The final checkbox is used to enable the widget.

2. Simplify admin area side menu

These checkboxes can be used to hide unnecessary items on the admin side menu. 

3. Add individual menu items from the submenus

These two checkboxes can be used to give clients access to the 'Widgets' and 'Menus' pages in case 'Appearance' has been disabled.

4. Simplify pages and posts

These checkboxes remove meta panels from the pages and posts areas.

5. Simplify other areas

A few more options to hide unnecessary widgets on the main dashboard, and menu items in the top admin bar.


Changelog:
