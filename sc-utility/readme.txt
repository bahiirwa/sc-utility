Version 1.0


This is a small plugin designed to be used on websites managed by Simply Computing.

The utility panel has six sections:

1. Dashboard widget information

These fields are used to add a dasboard widget giving the client the support details for contacting the website developers. The final checkbox is used to enable the widget.

2. Simplify admin area side menu

These checkboxes can be used to hide unnecessary items on the admin side menu. 

3. Add individual menu items from the submenus

These two checkboxes can be used to give clients access to the 'Widgets' and 'Menus' pages in case 'Appearance' has been disabled.

4. Simplify pages and posts

These checkboxes remove meta panels from the pages and posts areas.

5. Simplify other areas

A few more options to hide unnecessary widgets on the main dashboard, and menu items in the top admin bar.

6. Security

Enter your admin username in this field to give yourself exclusive access to this utility. Other admin users will not see any link on the side menu. Caution: If you enter the wrong username you will be locked out!
